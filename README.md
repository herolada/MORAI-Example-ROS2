# MORAI Example ROS2

Check that your MORAI SIM is configured correctly for communicating over ROS2 with this open-source example project

## File structure
```
./

     ├── morai_ros2_connector         # script for MORAI Simulator to open ROS2 service
     ├── morai_ros2_msgs              # MORAI Simulator ROS2 message set (submodule)
     └── morai_sim_examples           # example ros2 nodes and unit testing code
```

## Requirements

- **Notice**: we will be slowly phasing out support for sunsetted versions of ROS2 such as Eloquent and Foxy.

| ROS 2 Version | Supported | Ubuntu | Python |
|---|---|---|---|
| Eloquent | 🟢 | 18.04 | 3.6 |
| Foxy | 🟢 | 20.04 | 3.8 |
| Galactic | 🟢 | 20.04 | 3.8 |
| Humble | 🟢 (Updated 2025.12) | 22.04 | 3.10 |
| Iron | Not supported | 22.04 | 3.10 |
| Jazzy | 🟢 (Updated 2026.1) | 24.04 | 3.12 |
| Kilted | Not supported | 24.04 | 3.12 |

- The bridge scripts will remain fixed to each version, but the example codebase will adopt whichever version is the most recent. (i.e. if Humble is the most recent supported version, all source code will be tested on Humble only)
- Ubuntu version should match the ROS 2 distro (e.g. Humble --> Ubuntu 22.04)
- Python version should also match the ROS 2 distro (e.g. Humble would by default match with Python 3.10)

### Dependencies with MORAI SIM

This example repository is compatible up to MORAI SIM 24.R2.H2.

With the release of 26.R1., ROS2 Humble is natively supported by the simulator, no longer requiring the `morai_ros2_connector` script to connect to the ROS2 network.

## Setup

```bash
$ mkdir ~/ws_morai_sim_example
$ cd ~/ws_morai_sim_example
$ git clone https://github.com/MORAI-Autonomous/MORAI-Example-ROS2.git
$ source /opt/ros/<your ROS2 version>/setup.bash
$ colcon build
$ source /install/setup.bash
```

## Use

```bash
$ source /install/setup.bash
$ ./morai_ros2_bridge_<ros2 version>
```

If successful, the terminal should show: `MORAI Bridge: <version>`, followed by connection information.

## Troubleshooting

Library dependencies can lead to the bridge executable failing to correctly start. Some libraries that may not be part of a standard wsl install that may need to manually installed are:
- libabsl-dev
- libgrpc++-dev
